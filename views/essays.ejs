        <h2>How Art Can Be Good</h2>
        <h4>Fri December 8 2006</h4>
        <p>I grew up believing that taste is just a matter of personal preference. 
            Each person has things they like, but no one's preferences are any better than anyone else's. 
            There is no such thing as good taste.Like a lot of things I grew up believing, 
            this turns out to be false, and I'm going to try to explain why.
            One prob<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">lem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that
            it also means there's no such thing as good art. If there were good art, then people who liked
            it would have better taste than people who didn't. So if you discard taste, you also have to
            discard the idea of art being good, and artists being good at making it.It was pulling on 
            that thread that unravelled my childhood faith in relativism. When you're trying to make 
            things, taste becomes a practical matter. You have to decide what to do next. Would it make
            the painting better if I changed that part? If there's no such thing as better, it doesn't
            matter what you do. In fact, it doesn't matter if you paint at all. You could just go out 
            and buy a ready-made blank canvas. If there's no such thing as good, that would be just
            as great an achievement as the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Less laborious, certainly, 
            but if you can achieve the same level of performance with less effort, surely that's more
            impressive, not less.</span></p>

        <h2>The Origins of Wokeness</h2>
        <h4>Mon January 15 2025</h4>
        <p>The word "prig" isn't very common now, but if you look up the definition, it will sound familiar. 
            Google's isn't bad:<br>A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if superior to others. 
            This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and its age is an important clue: it shows that
            although wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an instance of a much older one.
            There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a shallow, exac<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">ting kind of moral purity, and who 
            demonstrates his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every society has these people. 
            All that changes is the rules they enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. 
            In Stalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the woke, it's social justice.
            So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask is not why people behave this way. 
            Every society has prigs. The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about these ideas, 
            at this moment. And to answer that we have to ask when and where wokeness began.
            The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a second, more aggressive wave of political 
            correctness, which started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and then returned with a
            vengeance in the early 2010s, finally peaking after the riots of 2020.
            This was not the original meaning of "woke," but it's rarely used in the original sense now. 
            Now the pejorative sense is the dominant one. What does it mean now? I've often been asked to define
            both wokeness and political correctness by people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. 
            They both have the same definition: 
            An aggressively performative focus on social justice. 
            In other words, it's people being prigs about social justice. And that's the real problem â€” the performativeness, not the social justice.
            Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on the scale that the woke believe it to be, 
            but a genuine one. I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The problem with political 
            correctness was not that it focused on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in which
            it did so. Instead of going out into the world and quietly helping members of marginalized groups, 
            the politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for using the wrong words to talk about them.</span></p>
